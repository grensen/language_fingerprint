Language Fingerprint: An interesting idea to visualize the relationships between characters in a language. The demo is built from scratch in WPF C# without XAML. You can ask your LLM or use this guide how to install. 
The demo reads characters from a website, then counts which character follows each one. The image on the left shows the confusion matrix, while on the right is the language fingerprint, which connects characters with lines based on their frequency. 
Use the mouse wheel to switch between websites, a mouse click even animates the process. It's a nice idea and a lot of fun.
